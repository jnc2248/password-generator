# **Password Generator**

## **Description**

I built a password generator that starts off by asking the user a series of questions. It then provides a randomized password that satisfies the requirements that the user chose.

## **Usage**

Navigate to this URL: https://jnc2248.github.io/password-generator/

Press ‘Generate Password’ when ready to begin. Answer the questions that come up in the prompts. Afterwards, your randomized password will be generated and displayed in the text box.
